# Repository Guidelines

This repository is a MonkeyDev-based iOS reverse engineering project. It contains a host app plus an injected dynamic library used to hook and inspect target applications.

## Project Structure & Modules

- `I2CppDumper/`: MonkeyDev host app, configs and scripts.  
  - `Config/MDConfig.plist`: MonkeyDev and target app configuration.  
  - `TargetApp/`: Place decrypted `.app` or IPA contents here.  
  - `Scripts/quick-resign.sh`: Helper for resigning/build packaging.
- `I2CppDumperDylib/`: Injected dylib with hook logic.  
  - `Config/`, `Logos/`, `Trace/`, `AntiAntiDebug/`, `fishhook/`, `Tools/`: Hooking, tracing, Cycript and anti‑anti‑debug utilities.
- `LatestBuild/`: Output artifacts generated by Xcode/MonkeyDev.

## Build, Run & Development

- Open `I2CppDumper.xcodeproj` in Xcode.  
- Select the MonkeyDev scheme targeting your device, ensure `TargetApp` is configured, then run (`⌘R`) to build, resign and install.  
- Use `quick-resign.sh` from `I2CppDumper/Scripts` for resigning an existing build when needed.

## Coding Style & Naming

- Objective‑C and Logos code: 4‑space indentation, brace on same line.  
- Class names: `PrefixFeatureName` (e.g. `MDConfigManager`).  
- Categories: `ClassName+Feature`.  
- Prefer clear, descriptive method names over abbreviations.

## Testing & Verification

- There is no formal unit test suite; verify changes by running on a real device.  
- For hook changes, test with a sample target app in `TargetApp/` and confirm logs, Cycript/LLDB behaviour and stability.

## Commits & Pull Requests

- Commit messages: follow short, imperative subjects (e.g. `feat: 添加 Il2Cpp dump`, `fix: 修复 Cycript 崩溃`).  
- Each PR should: describe the motivation, list key changes, mention how it was tested (device, iOS version, target app), and include logs or screenshots when relevant.
